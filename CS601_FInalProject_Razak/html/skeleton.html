        <h2>Early Years</h2>

        <p id="'history">I was born in Pakistan in the early 90's and emigrated to the United States when I was
            seven years old with my mom and older brother. My dad and uncle picked us up from the airport and I remember feeling
            confused because it was day time when we landed and I could have sworn we were traveling for a really long time.
            The short car ride to our apartment in Brooklyn was awesome because I got to stick my head out of the sunroof. Over
            the years we got to move to different parts of the 5 Boroughs and experience city life. That experience played an
            integral part in my development into adulthood.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p class="history">If my life needed to have a label it would be traveler. After spending years in NYC I wanted a change, I
            picked up my life, packed it in a few suitcases, and moved 8 hours away to northern New York, the goodbye with my
            family was heart wrenching but important. In Potsdam, I earned my Bachelors in Science in Aeronautical Engineering.

            Collins Aerospace</a>. My most recent project involves validating the design of an air quality unit aboard Navy
        Ships. My work is challenging and important for the life support of sailors on board. Suffice to say I feel
        valued and am content with the current state of things.

        <p class="history">
            Outside of work my main goal is develop myself spiritually and physically. I am actively learning
            how to read the Quran in arabic. I also frequent the local <a href="https://bigskyfitness.com/vernon/">Big Sky</a>
            gym to shed the seasonal weight and am building a solid routine doing that.
