        <h2>Test Engineering</h2>

        <p>As a test engineer I am in the business of writing procedures based on customer specs to validate customer
            requirements. These procedures are executed by skilled technicians. Writing procedures that are indicative of real world
            application requires forethought and a detail orientated mind. Stepwise instructions requires the writer to
            imagine the obstacles an operator may face and try to make performing the task as easy as possible. Performing the
            test is a collaborative effort that involves my
            oversight and their skilled labor. Test data is collected using data acquisition systems and presented to internal
            inpsection.</p>

        <h2>Work Style</h2>
        <p>
            I am adept at working in both a team environment and independently. I have the confidence to start a new task and
            perform the steps necessary to understand what needs to be done and take the necessary steps to complete it. In a
            team setting the dynamics change. I am a strong believer in contributing but not dominating. This type of attitude
            is off putting to those who may be shy or timid of their ideas. I like to put forth my opinion and do so strategically
            so as foster an all inclusive environment. When working independently I like to focus intensly on the task at hand.
            The office is not what you would call a library, so I usually through on my noise cancelling headphones and play
            white noise to dig in. Check out the video if you wish. </p>
